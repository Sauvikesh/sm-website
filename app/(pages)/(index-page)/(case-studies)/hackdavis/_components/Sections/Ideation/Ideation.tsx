Configuring the metadata on mobile was a challenge because of the limited horizontal space, and I iterated several times. Incorporating imagery made the prizes more visually enticing, and placing the text underneath accommodated longer strings of text, therefore preventing awkward truncation."

          sponsors feel more connected to HackDavis and increases
          credibility. In my initial iterations, the user was required to click
          on a thumbnail to view details on an individual. However, this
          triggered unfamiliar scrolling behavior if the thumbnail and larger
          image were not in the viewport simultaneously. To solve this problem,
          I grouped individuals by their teams and implemented filters, which
          also reduced cognitive load by showcasing one person at a time."

          smaller cards with a lighter opacity reinforce more meaningful color
          associations with CTAs."

          notified me that the loading time for the landing page was slower than
          anticipated due to the size of the illustration files. In order to
          achieve the parallax scrolling effect, we used PNGs, which are
          significantly heavier than other file types. After reading about the
          various options for loading screens, I implemented a skeleton loader
